### Project Motivation

Being interested in Armenia and in the entire region of Caucasus, one peaceful day I got hit by the news saying that the outbreak of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict took place once again. One of the easiest and most accessible form of communication nowadays is social media. Especially during the military conflict the possibility of every single human being with an access to the internet to spread the fake news is significant. <br>
Many years ago, in most of the cases both sides of the conflict were separated from each other, didn't have a possibility to communicate with the outer world and even more with an enemy. Nowadays that what seemed impossible many years ago became a matter of few clicks and at the same time became a weapon almost as strong as armament. <br>
Being able to bring anxiety in your enemy lines can let you win a lot, whereas is as simple as publishing new facebook status or tweet. But how others can become more aware of fake news spreading across the internet and what's more, how can they verify them and differentiate from the real news.
